It's the second time when I got "403 Access Forbidden" in XAMPP under Mac OS X. First time I solved somehow.<br />Today I found what the problem is. I just set my User and Group parameters in /Applications/XAMPP/etc/httpd.conf.<br /><br />You may think it's obvious but I've never set this things on Linux.
