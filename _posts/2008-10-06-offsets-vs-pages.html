Last days I work a lot with javascript grids for jQuery and wonder:<br />1) why developers of these grids use pages in requests for data from server. When using offset gives more clean code on server side.<br />2) of using page number from response. So server has to send that what it receives. It's weird and useless.<br /><br />So I rewrite some code in grid.
