<p>Harmonica was one of things I want to have. It's small and sounds cool. I associate it with Wild West and cowboys.</p><p>A month ago I saw a harmonica in music store and I said myself to buy it.</p><p>Today I purchased another one than I saw. I didn't know types, how to play on it. The thing I assess was count of  holes )). I choose Yamaha SS 220.</p><p>I found that it needs to inhale too, not only blow )). It takes half an hour to understatnd positions of note and I played simple melodies.</p><p>Found some information on web about harmonicas. Type of mine is Chromatic Single. It has two rows of holes. Upper row gives C# scale and lower gives C scale. There are 44 holes, 22 on each row.</p><p><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ZJeRI1VZW5g/SedjeeTlY1I/AAAAAAAAAKY/Cmh8WwCGF8g/s400/yamaha_ss_220.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5325334459571331922" /></p><p>P.S. There, in Yamaha music store, I played on electronic drums. They're sooo coool. I wish them. Drums are compact it's important for my appartment. You control a volume and also they're pluggable to headphones. Aaaaaaa!!! I want I want  I want them. With my real drums I feel discomfort when I play cause of my neighbors and thin walls. Somebody, give me 1500 dollars!</p>
