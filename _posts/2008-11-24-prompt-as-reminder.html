i have a lot wishes and always working to get them. but it's known the less aims we have the faster we reach it. i use "reminders" for more needed wishes. reminders are notes, posters, pendants, wallpapers everything i see often that remind me about that wish. more thoughts more possible ways to realize.<br />since i use urxvt without transparency i don't need wallpaper which was good reminder. instead of it i use prompt string.<br /><br />changing prompt string in bash<br /><blockquote>PS1='myprompt_string'</blockquote><br /><br />i add this string to my ~/.bashrc<br /><blockquote>PS1='c2d notebook: \w> '</blockquote><br /><br /><strong>\w</strong> escape sequence prints current working directory.<br />all escape sequences you can find <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/bash-prompt-escape-sequences.html">here</a><br /><br />i hope i'll buy core2duo notebook this month.
