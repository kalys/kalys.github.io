<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I released two applications for local-country use so far:<br /><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kursy-valut-nbkr/id465920646?mt=8">Currency rates of our national bank</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/k-news/id534962488">news application</a>.<br /><br />Programing iOS devices is very funny.<br />I had very little experience of C programing and knew how memory, cpu, compilers work from university and this knowledge helped a lot.<br />There is a long way before I can say that I'm experienced in this field but I released more or less stable product and I'm very glad of it.<br /><br />Now I'm reading Kochan's "Programing Objective-C" book. Strong familiarity with ObjC will help me improve a level of my apps.</div>
