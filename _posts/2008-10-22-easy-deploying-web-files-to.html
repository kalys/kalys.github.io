I'm developing UI on javascript for project with Glassfish (sjsas). Application server works on local machine. It's tiring to copy changes to glassfish's web dir after editing in workcopy dir. I can edit js files in glassfish dir but several times I forgot to copy changes to workcopy dir. First I want to change docroot or alternative docroot option to my workdir copy but some reason I can't change it. After this I create symlink in web dir to workcopy dir but glassfish doesn't understand symlinks.<br /><br />So I choose the most simple way by copying with cp.<br /><pre>cp -Ru _workcopy_/_web_files_dir_ _glassfish_domain_dir_/ </pre><br />I create shell script with this command in my home bin dir and bind to F9 functional key in vim editor.
