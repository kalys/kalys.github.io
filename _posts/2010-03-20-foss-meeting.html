Today I was at the malaysian FOSS community meeting.<br />As usual for this kind of meetings there were presentations.<br />Victor Yap told about Blender, changes between versions 2.49 and 2.50. Show several movies of Durian team (<a href="http://durian.blender.org">http://durian.blender.org</a>) and movie of his team with nice girl and lion.<br />In next short presentations I got information about Hackerspace in Kuala Lumpur.<br />And next presentation was really interesting for me. Presenter told about Arduino (<a href="http://durian.blender.org">http://arduino.cc</a>). Very nice hardware solution. I think I'll play with Arduino very soon.
